 # Grid layout best practices

**[Read this *short* manual from Umbraco]( https://our.umbraco.org/documentation/getting-started/backoffice/property-editors/built-in-property-editors/Grid-Layout/Grid-Layout-Best-Practices)**
 
 ### TL;DR
 **Keep it simple**
 
 * The grid should primarily be used to replace content entry in a rich text editor (RTE)
* The grid cannot solve every problem, neither was it meant to. If you put a standard grid editor on every page, expecting editors to do magic, you will be disappointed - and so will your editor.
